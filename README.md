Self-Organized sorting around radioactive particles
===================================
Exist some particles, e.g. radioactive particles, that must be isolated to avoid propagate their effects.

Inspired by the biological phenomena of *chemotaxis* and the distribution model of gas particles
  a new algorithm is proposed to self-organize radioactive particles.

Two types of agents are initially randomly placed in a toroidal environment, one of them emit radiation
  and the other one try to isolate them.

These agents self-organise into a complex aggregate consisting of a group of radioactive agents
  surrounded by insulating agents. This paper describes the self-organized sorting algorithm.
