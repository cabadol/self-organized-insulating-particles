<h2>Self-Organized Sorting inspired in Chemitaxis and Gas Particles</h2>
By Carlos Badenes
</table>

<p>The sorting of heterotypic cell populations is produced by a variety of inter-cellular actions,
    e.g. differential chemotactic response, adhesion, rigidity, and motility.</p>
<p>Via a process called chemotaxis, living cells respond to chemicals released
    by other cells into the environment</p>
<p>The algorithm was implemented based upon the description in
<i>Self-Organized sorting of heterotypic agents via a chemotaxis paradigm</i> by
    Linge B., Manolya E., Peter I. and David E.</p>
